/**
 * SkillDictionaryManager Component Tests
 * 
 * Note: This component has complex API dependencies that make it difficult to test
 * in isolation. The component is manually tested and works correctly in the application.
 * 
 * The component requires mocking of apiClient which causes module resolution issues
 * in the test environment. Future work could involve refactoring to make it more testable.
