This is a full-time role starting with a focused 6-month project, offering strong autonomy and fast execution in a product-driven environment. You will act as a hands-on utility player, working across frontend, backend, integrations, and light architecture while shaping a cohesive, customer-ready system. Successful delivery opens the opportunity to continue on other impactful projects.

Design and build backend functionality to support billing rules, chargeback logic, and ROI calculation for AI usage;
Integrate external billing data sources, starting with Microsoft Azure billing systems;
Build and evolve APIs and data pipelines that translate raw billing data into usable financial insights;
Implement frontend functionality to surface metrics, dashboards, and data-heavy UI views clearly and pragmatically;
Make sound architectural decisions at a medium level of complexity, prioritizing maintainability and speed;
Collaborate closely with product stakeholders, operating with minimal process overhead;
Ensure smooth deployment and delivery workflows using Vercel;
Contribute to overall product cohesion by connecting disparate parts into a single, usable experience;
Work full-time on a 6-month project, with the opportunity to continue on other projects afterward.
