## About the Product

We’re building a high-throughput financial data and trading platform designed to operate at tick-level precision across multiple global exchanges. The system supports real-time analytics, trading workflows, and decision-making tools used by active market participants.

The team operates in an engineering-led environment where performance, reliability, and scalability are core priorities.

### The Role

We’re looking for a backend engineer to help design and evolve the core services behind a real-time financial data and trading platform. This role centers on building low-latency services, scalable APIs, and fault-tolerant systems that ingest, process, and distribute live market data.

You’ll collaborate closely with frontend engineers, data engineers, and product stakeholders to deliver backend systems that traders and analysts rely on daily. While the role operates at a senior level, strong mid-level engineers with relevant experience are encouraged to apply.

This is a **fully remote position**, open to candidates across supported regions.

### What You’ll Be Doing

- Designing and building backend services optimized for real-time financial data
    
- Developing APIs and microservices with a focus on speed, resilience, and scalability
    
- Working directly with live market data, including feeds and trading-related events
    
- Improving system latency, throughput, and operational reliability
    
- Partnering with cross-functional teams to turn product requirements into technical solutions
    
- Taking ownership of backend services from design through production
    

### What We’re Looking For

- Solid experience building backend systems (typically 7–10+ years, flexibility for strong profiles)
    
- **Direct experience with trading systems or stock market data** (market feeds, order flow, execution, etc.)
    
- Strong proficiency in **Go (Golang)** for real-time or performance-critical systems
    
- Exposure to **Rust** is a plus
    
- Familiarity with **Node.js / Nest.js** is helpful but not required
    
- Strong understanding of concurrency, distributed systems, and low-latency architecture
    
- Experience with relational and time-series databases (PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, or similar)
    
- Knowledge of message queues, event-driven systems, and API design
    
- Comfortable working independently in a remote, fast-paced environment
    
- Startup-oriented mindset with a strong sense of ownership
    

### Nice to Have

- Experience in fintech or financial infrastructure
    
- Previous senior or technical leadership responsibilities
    
- Hands-on experience scaling systems under production load
    

### Logistics

- **Location:** Latin America or North America
    
- **Engagement:** Contract / Billable
