 POSITION SUMMARY

We’re looking for a Backend Engineer to join our Growth Engineering team, which builds the systems and experiments that help millions of people discover, onboard, and engage with EarnIn. You’ll work on high-impact product areas across the member journey — from activation to retention — designing scalable backend services that power rapid experimentation, personalization, and data-informed product decisions.

This role is ideal for an engineer who enjoys solving complex system challenges while driving measurable user and business outcomes. You’ll collaborate closely with cross-functional partners in Product, Data, Marketing, and Mobile to ship features that directly impact growth metrics.

This position will ideally be hybrid from our Mexico City office as part of our expanding site, though a remote arrangement is possible. EarnIn offers excellent employee benefits, including healthcare, internet and cell phone reimbursement, a learning and development stipend, and potential opportunities to travel to our headquarters in Mountain View. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location.

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

 

Design and implement backend features that drive EarnIn’s Growth funnel — from onboarding and cross-sell to retention and engagement.

Build and maintain scalable, event-driven microservices that enable experimentation, real-time personalization, and data-driven decision-making.

Collaborate with Product, Data, and Marketing teams to translate growth hypotheses into technical solutions and run experiments that move key metrics.

Ensure system performance, scalability, and reliability, especially under high throughput and real-time conditions.

Develop automation and testing frameworks to maintain velocity and confidence in continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

Debug and resolve production issues, working across multiple service layers to maintain system stability and uptime.

Proactively identify opportunities to generalize solutions, building reusable infrastructure and APIs that accelerate team development.

Partner with mobile, web, and analytics teams to ensure cohesive end-to-end experiences across platforms.
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 

3+ years of backend software engineering experience, ideally in distributed or microservice-based systems.

Strong fundamentals in service architecture and API design, with experience building reliable, performant systems at scale.

Proficiency in at least one modern backend language, such as Kotlin, Java, C#, or Python, and openness to learning new technologies as needed.

Experience with SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and familiarity with NoSQL systems is a plus.

Familiarity with event-driven patterns (queues, messaging, background jobs) and REST/gRPC services.

Collaborative mindset, with experience working alongside product, data, and design teams to deliver user-facing impact.

Strong testing and debugging skills, with experience maintaining high-quality services in production.

Excellent communication and problem-solving abilities, with a proactive approach to learning and iteration.

Bonus: Experience with experimentation frameworks, growth systems, or AI-powered personalization tools.
WHY YOU'LL LOVE THIS ROLE

High-impact engineering: Your code will directly influence how millions of members discover and engage with EarnIn.

Growth-oriented culture: Work in a team that values experimentation, data-driven decision-making, and learning fast.

Cross-functional collaboration: Partner closely with product, analytics, and marketing to ship features that make a measurable difference.
